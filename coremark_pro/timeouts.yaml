# Preparation and benchmark timeouts (in seconds)
#
# Since performacne is significantly different between different targets, timeouts need to be specified for each
# benchmark on each target. Some targets don't run all the benchmarks due too limited memory oor performance.
# The timeouts are specified only for the benchmarks that are run on the target.
#
# When new target is added, first run the benchmarks a few times with large timeout values to ensure they finish
# executing. Set the timeout to 150% of the highest preparation/execution time.
