# Preparation and benchmark timeouts (in seconds)
#
# Since performacne is significantly different between different targets, timeouts need to be specified for each
# benchmark on each target. Some targets don't run all the benchmarks due too limited memory or performance.
# The timeouts are specified only for the benchmarks that are run on the target.
#
# When new target is added, first run the benchmarks a few times with large timeout values to ensure they finish
# executing. Set the timeout to 150% of the highest preparation/execution time.
#
# Timeouts calsulated based on phoenix-rtos-project at a97c27ddb915019de88033b3734638796edef45e,
# phoenix-rtos-tests at fb5d67c4eeaf79698b141f19e83a9cc2963f329a
